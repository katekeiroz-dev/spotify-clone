## Spotify web app clone

- **Interface Inspired by Spotify:**
Layout and navigation similar to the official platform.<br>

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js** – Server-side JavaScript execution environment.
- **JavaScript** – Dynamic interface logic and manipulation.
- **HTML5** – Structuring of page content.
- **CSS3** – Interface styling and responsiveness.
- **Local API** – Data simulation for the application.
  <br><br>
  

> **Please note:**
> The music search is not yet functional, as it uses a local API based on a JSON file to simulate the data.
